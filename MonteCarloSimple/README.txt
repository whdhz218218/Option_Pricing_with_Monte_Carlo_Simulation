    First, the project name is: MonteCarlo1, both folders are under this project.
    There are two source folders: junit and src.  And we need to add mockito Jars to this class path.
    Please run the main class under "main" package under src to see the final result. The answers should look like:
Asian Option
14800 times
Mean: 2.230436678304061          
Sd: 5.581508825861527

European Call
66689 times
Mean: 6.405342855728391
Sd: 13.024760121585736
 
    The numbers would change every time, but they should be within some ranges.
